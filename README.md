# C-_memory_fixes
This repo is show cases great understanding of memory management and pointer handling in C++. In this project, I am taking on the role of a systems-level engineer tasked with identifying, debugging, and fixing common, yet critical memory issues in C++.  This isn’t theory. It’s a real, hands-on experience.
